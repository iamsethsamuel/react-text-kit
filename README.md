# React Text Kit

This is a collection of components that helps you create beatiful text effects and animations in your React project

## Usage

```typescript
import Glitch from "./animations/glitch/Glitch";

<Glitch style={{ fontSize: "2em", width: "100%", color: "white", textAlign: "left" }} animate>
    Edit save to reload.
</Glitch>;
```

It worked by just wrapping the text you want the effect to be applied to in with the effect component. You can completely customize the components with you custom style. Most of the styles are written in CSS, so making the library to be super light
